**QuickTrack**

A very clean implementation of a task time tracker app, which allows users to add their tasks and start tracking the time spent on each task. The tasks will be tracked and saved on internal storage of the user device allowing them to easily access the data without the need to have internet connection.

**Feature list
**
- Responsive design
- Add task name and track time
- Log tasks from history
- View total time spent on tasks
- Total tasks tracked
- Average time spent on a task

**Future implementations
**
We would like to integrate a reporting page that allows users to have a full breakdown of analytics, such as seeing chart view to see their progrses. 
Also, we would like to provide search and categorizaing tasks by day, so it's easier for the user to see their tasks.


**Instructions**
In order to have the application on your device, please follow the below steps:

- **Development** : Run `npm run dev` - This will start the development server and open the app in the default browser. You can then work with the files in the src/ folder and can see instant updates in the browser.
  
- **Production Build**: Run `npm run build` - This will produce a build edition that you can then deploy on the cloud/host on a static file service such as GitHub pages or surge.sh.

**Feedback**
We would love to hear your feedback for any future suggestions or features to be developed or bug reports.
